Example setup of a sphinxmix mixnet
===================================

For a minimal setup, let's consider four players: the server, two sphinxmix
contributors and an end user. We will run each one in a terminal with their
own configuration: set environment variable PANORAMIX_CONFIG to some
different file in each terminal.

Run panoramix-server-wizard, just press Enter for defaults and follow
instructions to setup the server.

Run two instances of panoramix-wizard. Choose role 'create' for the first
and 'join' for the second.

Select to create one invitation at the 'create' wizard and pass the value on
to the join wizard.

After you setup everything, you will reach something like:

  Ready to accept messages to mixnet http://127.0.0.1:8000/panoramix/endpoints/<endpoint_name>/

You have set up a sphinxmix network with two mixes, in a static
configuration (sorted alphabetically).

Then run sphimxmix-agent and initialize it with the mixnet URL. In another
terminal with the same PANORAMIX_CONFIG as the agent, run panoramix-client
and send some messages through the mixnet.

You can choose any string as recipient. After you send SIZE_MIN messages,
you can notice at the wizard terminals that the messages are being
processed.

Messages are not actually sent to a recipient, but you can review the mixnet
output with:

  panoramix outbox list --endpoint-id <endpoint_name>

You can also use the panoramix API client to view the (encrypted) input of
the mixnet with:

  panoramix accepted list --endpoint-id <endpoint_name>

or view all mixnet endpoints with:

  panoramix endpoint list

Panoramix mixnet server and client
==================================

Overview
--------

This repository includes three python packages:

  * panoramix: The main package that implements the mixnet logic
  * panoramix-service: A server implementing the panoramix API
  * panoramix-agent: A local agent


Installation
------------

In each of the three packages, run:

  python setup.py install

The panoramix package includes three cryptographic backends: 'gpg', 'zeus',
and 'sphinxmix'. In order to use them, you must install the respective
dependencies with:

  pip install -r requirements_<backend>.txt


Usage
-----

The service can be run with `panoramix-manage runserver --nothreading`.

The panoramix package provides a wizard (panoramix-wizard) to allow the
mixnet contributors to set up a mixnet (currently works with the sphinxmix
backend only).

The panoramix-agent package provides a local agent to enable an end user to
use a mixnet. As an example, sphinxmix-agent is a wizard to configure and
launch an agent for sphinxmix. The end user can send messages to the mixnet
by posting it to the local agent, using the panoramix-client.


Demo
----

Check file EXAMPLE for an extended description on how to setup and use a
sphinxmix mixnet. For a demonstration of Panoramix workflow, see

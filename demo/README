Panoramix Demo
==============

This directory contains a demo for each supported backend: 'gpg', 'zeus',
and 'sphinxmix'.

First initialize the mixnet database with

  ./demo/init.sh

and then start the server for the preferred backend in a terminal with:

  ./demo/launch-<backend>.sh

In another terminal, run the client-side demo; for 'gpg' or 'sphinxmix':

  ./demo/demo-<backend>.sh

For 'zeus', an extended interactive evoting demo is included that involves
two users: 'peer1' and 'peer2'. In two separate terminals, run:

  ./demo/demo-zeus.sh <peer_name>
